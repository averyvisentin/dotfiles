Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, which are configuration files used to customize various aspects of my Linux environment. These aren't world-changing, but they serve as a consistent setup across my systems.

Note: These dotfiles originally started off as the ml4w dots but have since significantly morphed into their own distinct configuration.

What's Included:
