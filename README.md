#Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, which are configuration files used to customize various aspects of my Linux environment. These aren't world-changing, but they serve as a consistent setup across my systems.

**Note:** These dotfiles originally started off as the ml4w dots but have since significantly morphed into their own distinct configuration.

## What's Included:

These dotfiles primarily configure:

* **Hyprland:** My Wayland compositor, including custom keybindings, window rules, animations, and general behavior.
* **Hyprpanel:** The configuration for my highly customized Wayland bar, defining its appearance, modules (like clock, battery, and network), and interactive elements.
* **Alacritty & Kitty:** Configurations for my preferred GPU-accelerated terminal emulators, including color schemes and keybindings.
* **GTK (3 & 4):** Theming and appearance settings for GTK applications.
* **Oh My Posh:** Custom prompt themes for my shell.
* **Pacseek:** Configuration for the Arch Linux package management TUI, including color schemes.
* **Qt (5 & 6):** Theming settings for Qt applications.
* **Systemd:** Adjustments to system and service management.
* **Yazi:** Settings for the command-line file manager.
* **MangoHud:** Overlay settings for monitoring game performance.
* **Vial:** Configuration related to keyboard firmware.
* **Rofi:** Theming and setup for this versatile application launcher and switcher.
* **AGS (A Gtk System):** Custom GTK-based widgets for system monitoring, a sidebar, and a calendar.
* **Various Scripts:** A collection of utility scripts for managing wallpapers, power options, keybindings, and other system interactions.

This collection aims to provide a cohesive and personalized user experience.
